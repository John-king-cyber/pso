Introduced by Kennedy, Eberhart, and Shi, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) stands as a metaheuristic algorithm that has found extensive application in engineering optimization. Its simplicity and efficacy contribute to its widespread utilization across various engineering and non-engineering domains. Inspired by the collective behavior of bird flocks, the algorithm naturally emulates this phenomenon. The animation below illustrates particles in action as they navigate the search space for the global minimum. [source: Wiki]
